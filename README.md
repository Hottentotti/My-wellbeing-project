# Wellbeing and Performance Booster

Lead yourself towards better wellbeing and performance by boosting your resources. 


## Summary

It is typical that people give more resources than they can receive. As they receive more resources than they give, they typically feel better and healthier. This way they can give more to life and work that also feed their recourses and body to make life more meaningful. 


## Background

It has been studied that generally 20-30% of employees experience fatigue, and that cannot help but affect their performance. It derives from the fact that their resources are not in balance. This solution boosts personal input such as recourses and resilience by improving personal self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, relaxing and enjoying, and emotional skills so that health, wellbeing and performance will be better. 

Problems to solve:
* People do not know themselves sufficiently.
* People cannot listen and sense themselves sufficiently.
* People cannot lead themselves sufficiently. 
* People cannot take care of themselves sufficiently. 
* People cannot relax and enjoy sufficiently. 
* People have poor emotional skills. 
* People have poor awareness skills. 


## How is it used?

The solution is used when people need personal assistance to have more resources for example to avoid or treat fatigue and exhaustion. This solution is meant for all kind of users such as employers, employees and umemployed and its idea bases on the figure (check below). The simple idea is that people should receive more recourses than they give so that they can give (and get) more. As a result people can have an own wellbeing receipt that helps them to better "input and output" everyday.

Figure explanations: 
* Voimavarojen saaminen = receiving recourses: meaningful work, sleep, activities, needs etc. 
* Voimavarojen antaminen = giving recourses: work, family, friends, activities etc.
* Voimavarkaita = stress factors: negative thoughts and emotions, bad fitness, bad sleep, bad work management, alcohol, bad conscience, unsafety, conflict of values, pushing hard etc. 
* Hyvinvoinnin pohja = base of recourses, wellbeing and resilience: self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, relaxing and enjoying, and emotional skills
* Oma raja = own border


## Data sources and AI methods

Data is collected by myself or someone else. Collected data aims for improving personal recourses and wellbeing by improving self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, and emotional skills. 

1. User signs in the application. 
2. User answers the survey and give inputs (check below). 
3. AI analyzes the data: user preferences and exceptions are included in neural network (deep-learning)
4. User gets a personal recipe (main points and details) for improving personal wellbeing and health
5. User can give feedback and the recipe is specified based on earlier recommended recipes with chatbot (Large Language Model). 

Inputs at the moment:
* sleep (quality, amount)
* nutrition (quality, amount, rhythm)
* physical activity (amount, diversity, timing)
* circadian rhythm (timing, person type) 
* emotions and thoughts (management, amount, quality)
* work (amount, breaks, timing, flow, readiness, meaningfulness, education, responsibility, values etc.)
* other health behavior (alcohol, smoking, emotions, relaxing, stress, awareness, needs, balance between work and freetime, helping etc.)
* resilience (stress, pain, cold, hot, illnesses etc.)
* readiness or alertness (timing)
* health status
  

## Challenges

Sometimes fatigue or exhaustion derive from health issues such as illnesses. This project cannot solve that kind of issues. Also some cultural issues cannot be solved with this solution. It is also possible that the recipe that AI has generated does not work for somebody. That is why the recipe should be modified if possible. In addition, people gives very personal inputs for analysis and thus data privacy need to be taken into account very carefully.


## What next?

This project will grow step by step. At first there are only a couple of parameters and some AI, but later much more. To move on, I need assistance for data collection, coding, UX/UI and AI.
