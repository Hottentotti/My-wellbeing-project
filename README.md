# Project title

Lead yourself towards better life by optimizing your resources (with personal advisor)

## Summary

It is typical that people give more resources than they can receive. As they receive more resources than they give, they typically feel better and healthier. This way they can give more to life and work that also feed their recourses and body. 


## Background
People are typically too tired or exhausted to receive or give resources. This solution improves personal recourses, wellbeing and health by raising personal self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, and emotional skills.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* People are typically not productive and helpful. 
* People cannot typically enjoy life.
* People do not typically feel well.
* People are not typically energetic and healthly.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)
![Cat](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5e/Sleeping_cat_on_her_back.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods

Data can be collected by myself or by someone else. Collected data aims for improving personal recourses and wellbeing by raising self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, and emotional skills.
Inputs:
* sleep (quality, amount, 
* nutrition
* needs (acceptance, closeness, love, 
* circadian rhythm (timing, person type, 
* activities
* emotions
* thoughts
* work (breaks, timing, flow, readiness, education, 
* health behavior (alcohol, smoking, emotions)
* stress (management, quality)
* resilience, readiness (pain, cold, hot)
* health status
  

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
