# Lead yourself towards better wellbeing and performance by optimizing your resources


## Summary

It is typical that people give more resources than they can receive. As they receive more resources than they give, they typically feel better and healthier. This way they can give more to life and work that also feed their recourses and body to make life more meaningful. 


## Background
It has been studied that generally 20-30% of employees experience fatigue that cannot help but affect their performance. It derives from the fact that people are typically too tired or exhausted to receive or give resources. This solution boosts personal input such as recourses, wellbeing and health by improving personal self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, relaxing and enjoying, and emotional skills so that performance is better. 

Problems to solve:
* People do not know themselves sufficiently.
* People cannot listen and sense themselves sufficiently.
* People cannot lead themselves sufficiently. 
* People cannot take care of themselves sufficiently. 
* People cannot relax and enjoy sufficiently. 
* People have poor emotional skills. 
* People have poor awareness skills. 


## How is it used?

The solution is used when people need personal assistance to have more resources (e.g., fatigue, exhaustion). This solution is meant for all kind of users such as employers, employees and umemployed and its idea bases on the figure (check below). The simple idea is that people should receive more recourses than they give so that they can give (and get) more. As a result people can have an own wellbeing receipt that helps them to better input and output everyday.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data can be collected by myself or someone else. Collected data aims for improving personal recourses and wellbeing by improving self-knowledge, self-confidence, self-management, self-care, self-sensing, self-listening, awareness, and emotional skills. The idea is that a user gives inputs after which the user gets a personal receipt for improving wellbeing and health. After that a user can specify the the receipt with chatbot if needed. AI methods consist of neural network with machine learning (deep learning). 

Inputs at the moment:
* sleep (quality, amount)
* nutrition (quality, amount, rhythm)
* needs (acceptance, closeness, touching, love etc.)
* circadian rhythm (timing, person type) 
* emotions and thoughts (management, amount, quality)
* work (breaks, timing, flow, readiness, meaningfulness, education, responsibility, values etc.)
* health behavior (activities, alcohol, smoking, emotions, relaxing, stress, awareness, helping etc.)
* resilience and readiness (stress, pain, cold, hot etc.)
* health status
  

## Challenges

Sometimes fatigue or exhaustion derive from health issues such as illnesses. This project cannot solve that kind of issues. Also some cultural issues cannot be solved with this solution. It is also possible that the recipe that AI has generated does not work for everybody. That is why the recipe should be modified if possible. 


## What next?

This project will grow step by step. At first there are only a couple of parameters and some AI, but later much more. To move on, I need assistance for data collection, coding and AI.
